The CellGuard iOS alerts users about possible rogue base stations nearby.

The repository consists of three directories:
- [CaptureCellsTweak](./CaptureCellsTweak): The tweak injected into iOS collecting cells the iPhone connects to
- [CapturePacketsTweak](./CapturePacketsTweak): The tweak injected into iOS collecting binary QMI and ARI packets
  - iOS and the iPhone's baseband utilize them for communication
- [CellGuard](./CellGuard): The CellGuard iOS app
- [Icon](./Icon): CellGuard branding assets
