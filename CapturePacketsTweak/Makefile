#             Specifies how undefined symbols are to be treated. Options are:
#             error, warning, suppress, or dynamic_lookup.  The default is
#             error. Note: dynamic_lookup that depends on lazy binding will not
#             work with chained fixups.
# CapturePackets_LDFLAGS = -undefined dynamic_lookup
